# ScamSpotter - Scam Message Detector

## 1. Project Overview
ScamSpotter is a lightweight web application that detects whether a given message is a scam or safe. With rising phishing attempts and scam messages, this project aims to build an easy-to-use interface to help users verify suspicious texts.

## 2. Data Summary
We used a subset of the publicly available SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains labeled SMS messages as 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam). For this demo, a sample of 6 messages is used for proof-of-concept.

## 3. Tools & Techniques
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data loading
- **scikit-learn** for TF-IDF and Naive Bayes classification
- **Streamlit** for UI
- **joblib** for model serialization

## 4. Approach
1. Preprocessed and labeled SMS data.
2. Trained a pipeline combining TF-IDF Vectorizer and Naive Bayes classifier.
3. Built a Streamlit app to allow users to input messages and get classification + confidence score.
4. Model is saved and reused to avoid retraining every session.

## 5. Results & Insights
- Real-time classification of scam messages works with high accuracy on sample data.
- The app displays confidence scores, helping users understand the severity of the message.
- Future improvement: Larger datasets, LIME/SHAP for model explainability.

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps
ScamSpotter is a foundational app showcasing real-world NLP use. To improve:
- Integrate larger, real-world datasets
- Add keyword highlights for flagged parts
- Deploy via Streamlit Cloud or internal servers
